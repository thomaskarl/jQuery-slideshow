# jQuery-slideshow

This is a simple and easy to use slideshow without any dependencies to install or and task manager to run.

The html talk for it self, the css is plain old css, and the javascript is written with jQuery.

All you need to do is copy the content from the `index.html`, `style.css` and the `script.js` and paste it into your website or download the three files.
